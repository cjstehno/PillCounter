# Pill Counter #

This is a simple Android (2.3) App that is useful for determining the number of pills required for a prescription either under
normal circumstances of when the dosage is being stepped down over a set period of time (titrating off a medication).

Your medication dosages should be discussed and set between you and your doctor, this application is for helping to make sure that the
doctor is counting correctly, not for determining a titration schedule. Use this application at your own risk.
