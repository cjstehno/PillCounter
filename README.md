# Pill Counter #

This is a simple Android (2.3) App that is useful for determining the number of pills required for a prescription either under
normal circumstances or when the dosage is being stepped down over a set period of time (i.e. titrating off of a medication).

After entering data about your medication dosage and reduction schedule values you can calculate and view the schedule or "Share" the results with other applications such as Email or a note-taking app.

This application in no way implies any dosage or schedule; it only provides a means of viewing the schedule. Your medication dosages should be discussed and set between you and your doctor,
this application is for helping to make sure that the doctor is counting correctly, not for determining a titration schedule. Use this application at your own risk.
